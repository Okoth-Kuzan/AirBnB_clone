Project Description
This project is an Airbnb clone, designed to mimic the functionality of the popular online marketplace for lodging, primarily homestays, or tourism experiences.

The Airbnb clone project aims to replicate core features of the original platform, including user authentication, listing properties, booking reservations, managing user profiles, and more. It provides users with a familiar interface and functionality while allowing developers to explore the architecture and implementation of such a system.

Command Interpreter Description
The command interpreter is a crucial component of the Airbnb clone project. It serves as the interface between users and the backend functionality of the application. With the command interpreter, users can interact with the Airbnb clone through a command-line interface (CLI).

How to Start the Command Interpreter
To start the command interpreter, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory.
Run the command interpreter by executing the console.py script.
bash
Copy code
$ python3 console.py
How to Use the Command Interpreter
Once the command interpreter is running, you can use it to perform various actions and interact with the Airbnb clone. Here are some common commands you can use:

create <class_name>: Create a new instance of the specified class.
show <class_name> <id>: Display details of the specified instance.
update <class_name> <id> <attribute_name> "<new_value>": Update the specified attribute of an instance.
destroy <class_name> <id>: Delete the specified instance.
all <class_name>: Display all instances of the specified class.
quit or EOF: Exit the command interpreter.
Examples
